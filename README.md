OVERVIEW:
Our base file is login.html which is for logging in to the game. After submission of login form we will be redirected to Home Page/ DashBoard
of the game. It will have three buttons:
    • Play : This button redirects us to our game where two players can play their game side by side.
    • Play With CPU : This button will redirect us to our game where the second player i.e player against us will be CPU.
    • History : This button will redirect us to our history of the game. It includes the details of last three games played each against CPU and
                against any other logged in player.
